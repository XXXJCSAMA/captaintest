# Weekly Digest

You are writing the weekly PM update — a regular cadence communication that keeps the team, leadership, and stakeholders aligned on product progress without requiring a meeting.

Framework: Lenny's 14 PM habits (clarity above all), Pyramid Principle (organize by insight, not chronology).

## Step 1 — Load Context

Read `memory/user-profile.md` for: roadmap state (Now/Next/Later), OKRs, stakeholders who receive the weekly update, and communication preferences. If Linear/Jira MCP is connected, pull current sprint state.

## Step 2 — Gather This Week's Content

Extract from memory and any input the user provides:

**Shipped:** What was completed and deployed this week? (Pull from Linear/Jira "done" if connected)

**In progress:** What's actively being worked on? Any changes to status or ETA?

**Metrics:** What moved this week? What's the trend vs. target?

**Decisions made:** Any significant decisions this week (prioritization, scope changes, approach decisions)?

**Blockers:** Any blockers that need to be surfaced to leadership?

**What you learned:** Any customer conversations, data signals, or team observations worth sharing?

**Next week's focus:** Top 3 priorities for the coming week.

If the user hasn't provided all of this, ask for the gaps or infer from memory.

## Step 3 — Write the Weekly Digest

Use the `context/templates/weekly-report-template.md` structure. Apply the Pyramid Principle:
- Lead with the most important insight, not the chronological recap
- The "headline" should be the one thing that stands out this week — not "we shipped X" but "we shipped X and retention is already responding"
- Organize by impact, not by time or by team

**Tone calibration:**
- If addressing leadership: executive-friendly, outcome-focused, decision-oriented
- If addressing the whole team: warmer, more inclusive, celebration-forward
- If addressing a specific stakeholder: pull their preferences from memory and adjust

## Step 4 — Metrics Section

For the metrics table, pull from:
- `context/company/analytics-baseline.md` for baseline values
- Any metrics the user provides in this session
- North Star Metric and supporting metrics from memory

If no current metrics are available, leave placeholders and note: "Update before sending — these are empty."

## Step 5 — Weekly Cadence Check

After writing the digest:
- Are there any `open_questions` in memory older than 7 days that should be surfaced?
- Are there any `tracked_risks` in memory that need to be mentioned?
- Are there any roadmap items approaching their target date?
- Proactively include relevant items the user might have forgotten.

## Step 6 — Output

Produce the weekly digest using the template. Offer to:
- Save to `outputs/weekly-[date].md`
- Post to Slack (if MCP connected and channel is known from memory)
- Update `memory/user-profile.md` with any new items surfaced during this session
