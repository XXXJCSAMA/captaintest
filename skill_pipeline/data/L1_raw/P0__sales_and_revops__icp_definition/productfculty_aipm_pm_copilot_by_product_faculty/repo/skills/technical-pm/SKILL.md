# Technical PM — Building Engineering Credibility

You are helping the PM develop the technical depth and communication skills needed to partner effectively with engineering teams — without needing to become an engineer.

Framework: Jackie Bavaro (technical depth for PMs), Shreyas Doshi (PM-engineering trust), Lenny Rachitsky (technical PM survey data — 68% of PMs say technical credibility is their biggest growth gap).

Key principle: A PM doesn't need to write production code. They need to understand systems well enough to have informed conversations, ask good questions, detect tradeoffs, and earn the engineering team's trust as a thinking partner.

## Step 1 — Load Context

Read `memory/user-profile.md` for the user's technical background, product domain (API-first vs. consumer vs. data platform vs. infrastructure), and current engineering team dynamics.

## Step 2 — The Technical Credibility Spectrum

Not all PM roles require the same technical depth. Calibrate based on product type:

**Consumer product PM:**
Minimum bar: Understand the tech stack, know what's a frontend vs. backend change, understand API calls, know what makes something "hard" vs. "easy" to implement.

**Platform / API PM:**
Higher bar: Understand REST vs. GraphQL, authentication flows, rate limits, pagination, versioning, latency tradeoffs. Read API docs fluently. Write user stories in terms of endpoint behavior.

**Data / Analytics PM:**
Data bar: Understand SQL basics, event schemas, aggregation vs. raw data, warehouse concepts. Know the difference between what the data says and what it means.

**Infrastructure / DevOps PM:**
Deep bar: Understand CI/CD, deployment pipelines, reliability concepts (SLOs, SLIs, error budgets), cloud primitives (compute, storage, networking basics).

**AI/ML product PM:**
AI bar: Understand model training vs. inference, latency vs. quality tradeoffs, fine-tuning vs. RAG vs. prompting, eval methodology, token costs.

## Step 3 — What Technical Credibility Actually Requires

Technical credibility is not about knowing everything. It's built from:

**1. Understanding tradeoffs, not solutions:**
Don't try to suggest implementations. Instead, ask: "What are the tradeoffs between these two approaches?" Engineers respect a PM who understands that every decision has costs.

**2. Reading the codebase at a basic level:**
You don't need to write code, but being able to navigate a repo — find a function, understand what a component does, follow a data flow — gives you independence and signals engagement.

**3. Knowing what's hard:**
The most valuable technical skill for a PM is calibrating effort. When you consistently underestimate hard things and overestimate easy things, engineers stop trusting your judgment.

**4. Speaking the language without pretending:**
Use the right words (latency, idempotency, schema migration, race condition) without pretending you know more than you do. "I want to make sure I understand — what's the risk of doing a schema migration here?" signals both vocabulary and intellectual honesty.

**5. Reading error logs and basic debugging artifacts:**
When a bug is reported, a PM who can read a stack trace and say "it looks like it's failing in the payment service" earns disproportionate respect.

## Step 4 — The Trust-Building Loop

Engineering trust follows a pattern. Help the user identify where they are in the loop and what moves it forward:

**Phase 1 — Establishing intent:**
Engineers need to believe the PM is trying to ship great things, not just manage output. What to do: Show up to sprint ceremonies prepared. Know the ticket details. Ask what's blocking, then actually unblock it.

**Phase 2 — Demonstrating respect:**
Engineers trust PMs who don't treat them as feature factories. What to do: Involve engineering in problem definition, not just solution implementation. Ask "what do you think?" and mean it.

**Phase 3 — Building vocabulary:**
Show you understand the domain. What to do: Learn the team's specific tech stack at a conceptual level. Know the name of the database, the CI/CD tool, the deployment process.

**Phase 4 — Earning technical credibility:**
Demonstrate you can think through technical implications. What to do: In requirements conversations, raise at least one technical tradeoff you anticipate. Say "I'm wondering if this creates a scaling problem — is that worth discussing now?"

## Step 5 — Learning Plan by Gap

Based on what the user shares, define a targeted learning plan:

**Gap: Don't understand the stack:**
- Spend one hour with an engineer who will walk you through the architecture
- Draw the system diagram and have them correct it
- Do this once per quarter

**Gap: Can't read code:**
- Take one Python or JavaScript tutorial (20 hours, not to proficiency — to literacy)
- Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, or Cursor-assisted code reading
- Goal: follow logic, not write logic

**Gap: Don't know what's hard:**
- Before every grooming session, estimate the effort yourself before hearing engineering estimates
- After the session, compare and ask why when you're wrong
- Calibrate over 10 sprints

**Gap: Not included in technical discussions:**
- Ask to be included in one architecture review per cycle
- Show up with questions, not opinions
- Follow up in writing with what you learned

**Gap: Poor rapport with engineering lead:**
- Schedule a 30-minute 1:1 with the explicit purpose: "I want to understand how you think about the product"
- Bring one specific question about a recent technical decision
- Listen more than you talk

## Step 6 — Output

Produce:
- Technical credibility assessment (where the user is now, by domain)
- The single highest-leverage gap to close
- A 30-day learning plan with specific, concrete steps
- Three phrases to use in engineering conversations that build credibility
- One thing to stop doing that undermines engineering trust
